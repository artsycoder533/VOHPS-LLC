        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div id="faq_questions">
            <h3>Why choose counseling?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Counseling affords benefits to the individual, including the prospect of reducing or eliminating distressing psychological symptoms, enhancing interpersonal relationships and resolving life crises or concerns.  To be successful, counseling presumes that you are honest, open and active in expressing your thoughts, behaviors, and emotions.  Often counseling may evoke strong feelings, which may include worries, fears, sadness, anxiety or depression.  Expressing such feelings is a basic element of counseling and encouraged.  Acting out, however, in violent or destructive ways is not condoned and may result in termination of services and/or communication of such patterns to other health care providers or law enforcement officials as a means of addressing safety.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>How do you connect with my insurance?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>On registering as a new patient, we will contact your insurance company in order to determine your copayment amount.  This amount will be collected from you prior to each counseling session.  Please let us know immediately if there are any changes to your insurance coverage.  We make every effort to promptly and accurately submit claims, but unpaid balances do remain the individualâ€™s responsibility.
            </p>
            <br>
